## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Citronics seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we would appreciate it if you could report it to us privately so we can address it before it becomes a public issue.

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing [security@nexevent.com](mailto:security@nexevent.com).

We will try to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and strive to send you regular updates about our progress. If you have not received a reply to your email within 48 hours, please follow up with us to ensure we received your original message.

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much information as possible, including:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any relevant code snippets or examples.
- Your contact information so we can follow up with you.

Thank you for helping to keep Citronics secure!
